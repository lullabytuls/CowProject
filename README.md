# CowProject

This project is prepared in the extent of an ongoing project of HAMK Smart. In the project, cows have been observed by a camera placed in the barn during their daily life. The purpose of the camera was evaluating the factors that are affecting the quality of the cow milk. These factors can be ordered as, their interaction with each other, how much food and water they consumed, ambiguity(because of the light issue in the barn depending on the day time morning/night) and etc. In order to evaluate ther situation, the frames taken by the camera has to be captured and labeled individually. In this part of the project, needed codework is done for labeling, framing. Tensorflow and keras are used for the resolution.
